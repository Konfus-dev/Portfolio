          <h1>Game development tooling that blends modern C#/C++ with human-centered UX.</h1>
          <p>
            I'm Jeremy Hummel, a software engineer specializing in game development tools, UI/UX systems, and gameplay-supporting applications. I build intuitive,
            powerful pipelines that help designers, artists, and engineers ship exceptional experiences across proprietary engines, Unity, and Unreal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Collaboration across disciplines keeps me energized, and I'm always stretching my skill set—whether that's designing visual scripting systems, crafting
            data APIs, or prototyping new workflows.

            <h2>Tools that respect creative flow</h2>
            <p>
              I specialize in translating complex problems into approachable tooling—whether that's editors for Diablo IV, custom tooling and systems for Unity, or
              backend APIs that keep civic data organized. I move comfortably between UX research, systems design, and low-level engineering so teams can iterate
              faster with confidence.

              Outside of development you'll usually find me gaming (Halo CE, The Witcher 3, Pokémon Emerald, and Dispatch are mainstays) or recharging outdoors by
              skiing, skating, hiking, biking, and traveling.
