Every retro workstation in my lab has a feline QA engineer. **Circuit**, a black cat with a fascination for power cords, loves curling around the warm CRT bezel during late-night builds. His littermate **Pixel** prefers napping on the MIDI keyboard but somehow never triggers a wrong note.

Keeping them happy means scheduling regular breaks, swapping keycaps before they get batted away, and running a dedicated "laser pointer sprint" at 0300 hours. The payoff? A studio that purrs right along with every synth drone.
