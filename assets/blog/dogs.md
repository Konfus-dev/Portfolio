When project timelines get wild, I grab a thermos, my ThinkPad, and the two dogs—**Radar** and **Echo**. We hike to a ridge with decent cell service, tether the laptop, and run usability tests while they stand guard against squirrels.

Their reward is a riverside fetch session while commits deploy. Mine is returning with fresh eyes, a clear head, and a TODO list annotated with muddy paw prints.
