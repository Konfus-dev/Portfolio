Hi, I'm **Jeremy Hummel**, a full-stack product engineer who loves weaving retro-futuristic stories into modern web stacks.

- 10+ years orchestrating immersive digital products across startups and creative studios
- Fluent in TypeScript, WebGL, GLSL, and the design systems that keep ambitious ideas coherent
- Currently exploring how tactile interactions and cinematic soundscapes can make tools unforgettable

When I'm not prototyping weird interfaces, you'll find me repairing synths, building tiny CRT mods, or recording ambient loops for fun.
