Echoes Lab is a storytelling microsite that invites visitors to experiment with synthwave-inspired soundscapes. Animated typography, responsive gradients, and orchestrated ambient tracks change as visitors explore each "lab station" to uncover the narrative.

My role covered experience design, motion prototyping, and production engineering. I tuned the timeline-based animations, built performant audio transitions, and ensured the story remained legible across devices without losing its immersive feel.
