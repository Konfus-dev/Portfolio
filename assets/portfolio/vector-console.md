Vector Console is a prototyping deck for mission designers. The surface uses layered vector art, neon gradients, and animated overlays to make complex workflows feel tactile. Operators can patch virtual instruments together, tweak parameters with rotary-style controls, and export presets for further testing.

I led the interface architecture, composed the procedural iconography, and wired a responsive audio engine so every toggle and dial provides satisfying sonic feedback without overwhelming the signal path.
