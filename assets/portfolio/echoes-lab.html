  <p>Echoes Lab is a storytelling microsite that invites visitors to experiment with synthwave-inspired soundscapes. Animated typography, responsive gradients, and orchestrated ambient tracks change as visitors explore each "lab station" to uncover the narrative.</p>
  <p>My role covered experience design, motion prototyping, and production engineering. I tuned the timeline-based animations, built performant audio transitions, and ensured the story remained legible across devices without losing its immersive feel.</p>
