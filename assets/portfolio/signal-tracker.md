Signal Tracker is a cinematic WebGL control room that renders live orbital telemetry in a reactive starfield. Visitors can scrub through recorded transmissions, isolate satellites, and route spatial audio cues while the interface pulses with scanline effects and UI widgets inspired by deep space consoles.

Key contributions include building the GLSL shader pipeline, implementing synchronized audio-reactive UI states, and integrating live mission data streams so operators can demo the tool with authentic feeds.
